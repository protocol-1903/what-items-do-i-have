When the keybind is pressed (default: `ALT + Z`) a window will pop up, showing how much of that item is in the local logistic network (and of what quality!)

# Additional Features:
- Option to search the position of the remote view or the physical character position, when avaliable.
- Search a space platform hub for items while in remote view, or when on the platform.
- Updates the window when the item in the cursor changes. Toggleable with a shortcut and hotkey (default: `SHIFT + ALT + Z`). Useful when you like to pipette things
- Updates the window when hovering over entities in-world. Toggleable with a shortcut and hotkey (default: `CONTROL + ALT + Z`). Note, only works with entities in the world. Does not work on GUIs.

Supports all mods, hopefully. If something doesn't work, let me know!
